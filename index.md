## Summary

Welcome! I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Laboratory of Biology and Modelling of the Cell (LBMC) in Lyon, France.

### Mini-bio

After training in biology (Bsc) and bioinformatics (Msc), I did a PhD in bioinformatics at EMBL-EBI and University of Cambridge, UK, 
on developing novel approaches to genotype microbial pathogens, with a focus on antibiotic resistance genes in *M. tuberculosis* and 
cell-surface antigens in *P. falciparum*.

I then moved back to Lyon for a postdoc where I have been working on the evolution of a neo-Y chromosome and its ties 
with the emergence of a [strange mode of reproduction](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau0099) in nematodes, and of 
[Programmed DNA Elimination during early embryogenesis](https:/doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.07.058), also in nematodes.

### Research interests

* Evolution of cellular processes
* Evolution of reproductive systems
* Evolution of host-pathogen interactions
